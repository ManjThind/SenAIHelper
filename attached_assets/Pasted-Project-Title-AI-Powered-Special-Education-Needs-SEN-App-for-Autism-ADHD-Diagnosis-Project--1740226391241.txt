Project Title:
ðŸ§  AI-Powered Special Education Needs (SEN) App for Autism & ADHD Diagnosis

Project Description:
Develop an AI-driven diagnostic tool designed to assist in the early identification of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The app will leverage Facial Analysis, Voice Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, Writing Analysis, and Interactive Q&A to assess behavioral and cognitive patterns associated with these neurodevelopmental conditions.

Key Features:
1. User-Friendly Interface & Onboarding
Secure login for parents, educators, and professionals
Guided onboarding with age-based assessment options
Consent-based data collection for ethical compliance
2. Multi-Modal Diagnostic Analysis
âœ… Facial Analysis (Computer Vision)

Detect facial expressions, eye contact, and microexpressions using OpenCV & Deep Learning
Identify emotional inconsistencies or atypical facial patterns associated with ASD
âœ… Voice Analysis (Speech & Tone Recognition)

Analyze speech tone, pitch variation, pauses, and response delays
Detect monotone speech patterns (common in ASD) or hyperactivity in voice (ADHD markers)
âœ… Sentiment Analysis (Emotional & Behavioral Insights)

Use NLP (Natural Language Processing) to detect emotional states from verbal/written responses
Identify frustration, anxiety, or lack of engagement based on speech and text patterns
âœ… Writing Analysis (Handwriting & Typing Pattern Recognition)

Analyze handwriting (if tablet-enabled) for fine motor skills and pattern irregularities
Monitor typing speed, consistency, and grammatical structure for cognitive assessment
âœ… Interactive Q&A Analysis (Behavioral & Cognitive Evaluation)

AI-driven interactive questions designed to measure attention span, impulse control, and social understanding
Scenario-based responses analyzed for pattern recognition and behavioral insights
3. Personalized Diagnostic Report & Recommendations
Generates a detailed assessment report with likelihood scores for ASD/ADHD
Provides personalized recommendations (e.g., therapy options, learning support tools)
Option to share reports with professionals for further evaluation
4. AI-Powered Chatbot for Parents & Educators
Answers questions about symptoms, therapies, and interventions
Provides daily exercises and cognitive training activities for support
5. Data Privacy & Compliance
Ensures GDPR & HIPAA compliance for data protection
All video/audio/text data anonymized and encrypted
Users can delete data at any time
